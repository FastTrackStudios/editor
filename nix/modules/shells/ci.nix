# CI shell — the default shell minus every interactive convenience.
# No .env sourcing, no dx/Playwright/editor tooling, no sccache. Toolchain
# + native headers + the env the build scripts need, nothing else.
# Workflows enter it via `nix develop .#ci`.
#
# tailwindcss and node ARE here, despite "CI drives plain cargo":
# apps/{web,desktop,mobile}/assets/tailwind.css is gitignored build output
# that `asset!()` demands at compile time. `dx` generates it during a
# normal dx build, but CI drives plain cargo, so the workflow runs the
# `css` recipe first — which needs the binary AND the tailwindcss module
# resolvable from node_modules.
