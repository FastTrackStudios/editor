//! The `<Editor>` Dioxus component.
//!
//! v1 architecture: a `<div contenteditable="plaintext-only">`
//! whose text content is bound to `state.doc`. Phase A here is
//! plain text only (a single rendered text child). Phase B adds
//! decoration rendering as per-segment spans.
//!
//! ## Why contenteditable now (and how the cursor stays put)
//!
//! Contenteditable lets us render styled text (decorations) and
//! still get a real caret. Textarea can't show inline styles.
//!
//! The trick to not eating the cursor on every re-render is:
//! **render the same text Dioxus already has in the DOM**.
//! Typing flow:
//!
//!   1. user presses 'a' → browser updates DOM textContent to "...a"
//!   2. our JS bridge reads the new textContent, computes a diff
//!      against the old `state.doc`, and applies a Transaction
//!   3. Dioxus re-renders. The text child is `"{text}"` where
//!      text == the new doc, which equals what the DOM already
//!      contains. Dioxus's reconciler sees text node value
//!      unchanged → emits no DOM mutation → caret untouched.
//!
//! For programmatic edits (a command, undo, remote CRDT op) the
//! state diverges from the DOM. Dioxus updates the text node;
//! the browser parks the caret at offset 0. A `use_effect`
//! restores it from `state.selection` — but only when the DOM
//! text already matches state.doc (preventing the writeback
//! from fighting in-flight typing).

// `DecorationSource`'s fn-pointer fast path compares by fn
// address; within a single binary fn-ptr equality is reliable
// enough for prop-diff purposes. The lint guards against
// codegen-unit splits that don't happen in our build.
